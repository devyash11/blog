                Powerful ideas to live a life true to yourself. Knowledge and wisdom are easily accessible via books, Internet and one's personal experience. I am continuously looking for authors, speakers and circumstances that can help me become a better person and add quality to my days
 Lines; are you drawing yours? 
I don’t know what’s going in your life right now but I need to remind you the importance of being firm in what you want. There’s a common misconception that people who take their stand aren’t agreeable, don’t like getting along with others and are very problematic. Maybe so, but you know what? They get exactly what they want. They lead lives they want, make relationships that are mutually beneficial to them and take vacations they deserve.<br><br>
Speak up. Talk. Air out your grievances. Tell them your conditions. But most importantly follow through. Because if you don’t stick by the same rules you demand of others, that’s the end of it. There’s your loophole and their leverage. This applies across your life, among your friends, your significant other, your job, your neighbors everything, everything, everything. TO HEAR THE UNHEARD IS THE NECESSARY DISCIPLINE OF A GOOD RULER .. So, what I my my past six  years of school have learnt to be a good leader who takes everyone together. Your identity is not just your grade but how much at par you are considerate and passionate towards your duty. Circumstances won’t always favour you , neither it favoured me but get up , walk along and run . One day, when you would look back you would admire the beauty of those struggle . DON’T GIVE UP.<br><br> 
Draw the lines around your life of what falls in you and what doesn’t. Do away with what isn’t inside your circle. Be excellent in all you do from your house chores, duties, to your contracts and jobs.<br><br>

It is the road to the kind of life you live.<br><br>
While concluding I just want to add that we are not advocating to get quality only through this way and don’t go for the things which creates some happiness and fun in your life. You should definitely go for all that provided you are aware of it’s limits and mode. Be constructive and confident with your thoughts and belief. Consciously live the moments or situations which come in your life no matter what’s the nature of these. To complete the quality process, you could share it with others once you get it in your life.
