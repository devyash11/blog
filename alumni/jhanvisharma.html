                Many of you might be lost right now in terms of your goals and passion. You might think you are running late in life than others, but believe me, almost every student is in the same position as you and its completely okay to feel that. The way society describes an ideal student life is – fixing a goal at an early age, spend half of your working for it and another half, working on it. But it’s funny because life if literally miles away from the word ‘ideal’. You won’t get any mail from god telling you the purpose of your life as soon as you hit sixteen. He is a busy man after all. That’s a thing which is for you to explore and find and that’s also where the actual adventure of life lies within. You need get out of that comfy bubble. Always keep on learning and expand your horizon. What is meant for you will never pass you by.
                <br>

                Competition and ranks are not everything. Beware of being the sheep who follows the crowd. Don’t run a race which does not belongs to you. Harboring ships of jealousy and hatred in your body is toxic for both you and those around you. Your own definition of success matters the most in your life, don’t try to measure it with someone else’s perspective. It’s all about your passion and drive. We must learn to appreciate each other qualities and achievement.
                <br>

                Lastly, you are special and beautiful just the way you are. How can the human with stardust gushing in their veins not be magical? The stars itself took time to evolve you, so love yourself. Sometimes we have to be the alchemist to turn the lemons into lemonade or a painter to paint the imagination into reality. Keep up the hard work and have faith soon the grey skies will be pastel hues. Appreciating yourself once in a while will heal all the broken smiles. Now smile and breathe cations. You deserve to be happy. Sending you a wreath of hopes
                <br>

                With love
                <br>
