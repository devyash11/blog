            ARE YOU AN IIT-JEE / OTHER COMPETITIVE EXAM ASPIRANT?

                If you have established a concrete mindset to crack JEE / NEET / Any other Competitive Exam, then here's what you should focus on. Don't erratically change your decisions about coachings and online platforms. It will just break your trust in them and nothing else. Stick with any coaching, but being aware is a necessity. You must know if the coaching is teaching the required syllabus or not. Remember this, Most of the IIT-JEE aspirants are not consistent about their schedule and study plans, and that's a key point to note why you must be consistent. If you can hit an unstoppable consistency, you'll qualify in the exam. Being in the top 100s and 1000s requires an extra push from your inside to achieve that rank. Being consistent is crucial, but it will take you to your destiny only and only if you use that ability with that extra push.

                If you belong to this category, then you're no different from me. I left IIT-JEE preparation when I got well after being sick for a few weeks. Those moments of my sickness were not my weakness but the door to my True Passion. I was deeply in love with Computer Science, though it never felt like it was my Passion. I explored, I found AI, and I'm fascinated by Robotics, I always was, from the days of Power Rangers. Try to find your True Passion. And, If you think that, oh! I've got many interests, which should I choose as my Passion? Then you're not alone in this situation. Everyone has faced it at least once in life. Eventually, you'll find your Passion. Until then, try to do something that gives meaning to your life or interests you most, as CS did to mine when I didn't know about AI. If that's a sport, go for it. If it's community service, well and good, go for it. Don't be a fool not doing anything, while the classroom isn't everything.

                First thing first, I'm delighted if you have no fear of dreaming high. If you won't dream big, how would it come true? So, to attend those top universities, you will have to study abroad in the US. You must be worried about paying that large amount of fee. But trust me, if you can reserve a spot for yourself in those universities, you'll make money like hell, guaranteed if you are CS/AI aspirant. Try to be excellent at your academics as well as your extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities will add extra weight to your application if you have a substantial achievement in those activities. To learn more about extracurricular activities, visit <a href='https://blog.prepscholar.com/list-of-extracurricular-activities-examples'>here</a>. In the US, SAT/ACT are the standardized tests that test your aptitude and are needed with a good score for admissions to a reputed college/university, depending on your Extracurricular status. In addition to this, some college-level online courses or exams will also increase your chances of admission. Taking these courses/exams shows the admission committee that you are committed to your future and ready to take challenges. Some of the online platforms that will help you learn at college-level:<br><br>
1.) <a href='https://www.edx.org/'>EdX - offers up to 90% of financial aid</a><br>
2.) <a href='https://www.Coursera.org/'>Coursera - contains 100% financial aid</a><br>

4.) <a href='https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm'>MIT(OpenCourseWare) - Free</a><br><br>
If you are interested in CS, try to explore high school summer research programs and explore Competitive Programming. If you are going for Competitive Programming, refer <a href='https://www.iarcs.org.in/inoi/'>National Olympiad Website</a>. If you are interested in any other subject, refer to their Official Websites for more information. Achieving a medal in Olympiad above the school level may get you to one of the top universities in the world. Keep these things in mind and, no one will be able to stop you achieve your destiny. Just make sure that you start working on it the moment you read this.

            WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF PIS AND MY TEACHERS IN MY LIFE?
        </header>

        <div>
            <p id=para1>
                Our world would have never be developed with time if Guru didn't exist. Gurus teach to evolve the world, and the same my teachers did to my world. The world I live in, the ambitions I have, are all possible because my teachers have shown me the right path. And if today/tomorrow, I'm recognized for something, it'll always be a Guru behind it. So if you are a student, start respecting your teacher before it's too late. Thanks to the PIS family for allowing me to be a part of it and my friends who have given me the most pleasant memories of my life. I have put all my love and effort into building this website, hope you like it.
