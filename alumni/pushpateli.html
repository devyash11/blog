            MESSAGE FROM PUSHPA TELI TO JUNIORS OF PIS, SURAT
        </header>

        <div>
            <p id=para1>
                Pushpa PIS: I am Pushpa Teli. I am here in this school PODAR INTERNATIONAL school from 4th class. The school has taught me so much in my life. Because of studying in PODAR. I learnt many things in my life, I learnt how to be self dependent, I learnt how to fight for our own problems. I learnt the best quality that is leadership. I have gained experience of being in council team for 2 years, which has taught me leadership qualities and also it helped me to be confident enough to be a good leader and lead my teammates.<br><br>
                
                The school has taught me humanity and kindness. During school years we have gone to many places like I have a very good experience of one event-"JOY OF GIVING"; in that students have distributed food, clothes, books and needy items to poor people.<br><br>
                Teachers of the school are best. They have given me so much to learn they have helped me so much in every field. Today whoever I am, it is just because of great teachers.<br><br>
                At last I would like to thank my school and all school Teachers for motivating me and helping me to be a good student. Thank you so much!! I'm so greatful for what this school has given me in last 7-8 years..!!<br><br>
                Thank you once again..
